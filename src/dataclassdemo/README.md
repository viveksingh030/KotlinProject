In Kotlin, a `data class` is a special type of class that is designed to hold data. Its primary purpose is to provide a convenient way to store and manage data without having to write a lot of boilerplate code. Here are the key features and benefits of using a `data class`:

### Key Features of Data Classes

1. **Automatic Generation of Utility Methods**:
    - **`equals()`**: Compares the content of the data class instances.
    - **`hashCode()`**: Generates a hash code based on the content.
    - **`toString()`**: Returns a string representation of the object.
    - **`copy()`**: Creates a copy of the object with optional modifications.
    - **`componentN()`**: Functions corresponding to the properties (for destructuring declarations).

2. **Primary Constructor**:
    - Must have at least one parameter.
    - Parameters are automatically used to generate the utility methods.

### Example

Here is an example to illustrate the use of a `data class`:

```kotlin
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)

fun main() {
    val user1 = User("Alice", 25)
    val user2 = User("Bob", 30)

    // Using toString()
    println(user1)  // Output: User(name=Alice, age=25)

    // Using equals() and hashCode()
    val user3 = User("Alice", 25)
    println(user1 == user3)  // Output: true

    // Using copy()
    val user4 = user1.copy(age = 26)
    println(user4)  // Output: User(name=Alice, age=26)

    // Using destructuring declarations
    val (name, age) = user2
    println("Name: $name, Age: $age")  // Output: Name: Bob, Age: 30
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Kotlin generates the necessary methods for `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, `copy()`, and `componentN()` automatically, reducing the amount of code you have to write.

2. **Immutability**: While not enforced, data classes encourage the use of immutable data structures by providing the `copy()` method for making modifications.

3. **Better Readability**: The automatically generated `toString()` method provides a clear and concise string representation of the data class, which is useful for debugging and logging.

4. **Destructuring Declarations**: Data classes support destructuring declarations, which allow you to unpack the properties of an instance into separate variables.

### When to Use Data Classes

- When you need to store a simple data structure without complex behavior.
- When you need to compare instances based on their data.
- When you want to avoid writing boilerplate code for common methods.

### Restrictions

- The primary constructor must have at least one parameter.
- All primary constructor parameters need to be marked as `val` or `var`.
- Data classes cannot be abstract, open, sealed, or inner.

By using `data class`, you can simplify your code and focus more on the logic rather than the boilerplate, making your Kotlin code more concise and readable.
