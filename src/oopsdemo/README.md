Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Kotlin is similar to other OOP languages, focusing on concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Here's an overview of how these concepts are implemented in Kotlin:

### 1. Classes and Objects

#### Class Definition
```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
    }
}
```

#### Creating an Object
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 30)
    person.greet()  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
}
```

### 2. Inheritance

In Kotlin, classes are final by default. To allow inheritance, you need to use the `open` keyword.

#### Base Class
```kotlin
open class Animal(val name: String) {
    open fun sound() {
        println("$name makes a sound")
    }
}
```

#### Derived Class
```kotlin
class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun sound() {
        println("$name barks")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val dog = Dog("Buddy")
    dog.sound()  // Output: Buddy barks
}
```

### 3. Interfaces

Interfaces in Kotlin can contain abstract methods as well as concrete methods.

#### Interface Definition
```kotlin
interface Drivable {
    fun drive()
    fun stop() {
        println("Vehicle stopped")
    }
}
```

#### Implementing Interface
```kotlin
class Car : Drivable {
    override fun drive() {
        println("Car is driving")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val car = Car()
    car.drive()  // Output: Car is driving
    car.stop()   // Output: Vehicle stopped
}
```

### 4. Encapsulation

Kotlin uses visibility modifiers to control the accessibility of class members: `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `public`.

#### Encapsulation Example
```kotlin
class Employee(private val id: Int, var name: String) {
    private var salary: Double = 0.0

    fun setSalary(newSalary: Double) {
        if (newSalary > 0) {
            salary = newSalary
        } else {
            println("Invalid salary")
        }
    }

    fun getSalary(): Double {
        return salary
    }
}
```

### 5. Abstraction

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and are used to define common behavior for subclasses.

#### Abstract Class
```kotlin
abstract class Shape {
    abstract fun area(): Double
}

class Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape() {
    override fun area(): Double {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius
    }
}

fun main() {
    val circle = Circle(5.0)
    println("Area of circle: ${circle.area()}")  // Output: Area of circle: 78.53981633974483
}
```

### 6. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class.

#### Polymorphism Example
```kotlin
open class Vehicle {
    open fun drive() {
        println("Vehicle is driving")
    }
}

class Bike : Vehicle() {
    override fun drive() {
        println("Bike is riding")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val vehicles: List<Vehicle> = listOf(Vehicle(), Bike())
    for (vehicle in vehicles) {
        vehicle.drive()
    }
    // Output:
    // Vehicle is driving
    // Bike is riding
}
```

### Summary

- **Classes and Objects**: Fundamental building blocks for OOP.
- **Inheritance**: Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.
- **Interfaces**: Define a contract that classes can implement.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricts access to certain components, enhancing security and modularity.
- **Abstraction**: Provides a way to define classes with abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows treating instances of different classes through a common interface.

Kotlinâ€™s OOP features help to create clean, modular, and maintainable code by leveraging these fundamental concepts.
